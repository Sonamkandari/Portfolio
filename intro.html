 <PRE>Hello,
 I'm Sonam Kandari, originally from the vibrant city of Dehradun. Currently,I'm pursuing mputer Science and Engineering at Doon Institute of Technology <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/DIT+University/@30.3997105,78.0755051,15.64z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x3908d70603f128a5:0x359bb8f9c7797984!8m2!3d30.4001975!4d78.0789774!16s%2Fm%2F0275pwm?entry=ttu">DIT</a>.
 During my first year at university, I had the opportunity to dive deep into the fundamentals of programming through C language and Data Structures and Algorithms. 
 These foundational concepts have equipped me with the  problem-solving skills essential for tackling complex challenges in the field of computer science.
 As I progress into my second year, I'm excited to broaden my skill set even further. Currently, I'm delving into Java programming, a  versatile language
 known for its robustness and wide range of applications. Additionally, I'm exploring the basics of web development, including HTML and CSS, which are 
 fundamental for creating engaging and user-friendly web  interfaces.Moreover, I'm also gaining proficiency in Linux, a powerful operating system widely
 used in the tech industryfor its stability and flexibility. Additionally, I'm learning Python, a versatile and in-demand programming language known 
 for its simplicity and readability. Furthermore, I'm acquiring the basics of SQL, a fundamental language for managing and manipulating databases, which 
 is crucial in today's data-driven world.
